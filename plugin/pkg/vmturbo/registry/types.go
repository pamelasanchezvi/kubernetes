	// GenerateName indicates that the name should be made unique by the server prior to persisting

	// value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened
	// or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that
	// a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
